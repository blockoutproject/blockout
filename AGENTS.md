# Blockout Agent Guidance

Repository skills live under `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

Start every repository task with `.agents/skills/blockout-best-practices/SKILL.md`. It routes to the detailed policies
needed for the current scope. Load other skills only when their description or the router explicitly triggers them.

Global rules:

- Speak French in chat and write repository files in English.
- Treat the imported standalone applications as the behavioral baseline.
- Use Maaatch as a read-only structural and naming reference; never copy its business code.
- Preserve runtime behavior unless the active task explicitly authorizes a correction.
- Keep contract-first/code generation and GitFlow/GitHub Project governance dormant until separate user-authorized tasks.
- Keep generated output, secrets, local environments, caches, logs, and build artifacts out of Git.
